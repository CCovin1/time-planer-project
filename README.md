## Usage
When you open the Work Day Scheduler, the current date and time will be displayed at the top of the calendar.
Scroll down to view the time blocks for each hour from 9 AM to 5 PM.
Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
Click into a time block to enter an event or update an existing event.
To save the event, click the corresponding save button (disk icon) for that time block.
The event will be saved in the browser's local storage, and it will persist even if you refresh the page.
You can enter events for different time blocks, and they will be saved separately.
To edit or remove an event, simply update or clear the text in the time block's textarea and click the save button.
